Compiling Reduma
*****************

 Follow these steps to compile Reduma on a Unix system.

  1. If you have built Reduma previously in the same directory for a
     different target machine, do `make clean' to delete all files
     that might be invalid. 

  2. Make sure that your system has either `gawk' (version 2.15 or higher)
     or nawk (gawk 2.13 has a bug).
     On a System V release 4 system, make sure `/usr/bin' precedes
     `/usr/ucb' in `PATH'.  The `cc' command in `/usr/ucb' uses
     libraries which have bugs.

  3. Run `configure' to configure the Makefiles for your machine.

         configure machine

     where machine is one of the following system:

         sun, apollo, next, sgi, hp, linux
 
     If you are trying to compile the Reduma on another machine,
     you have to edit several Makefiles (in the same way) by hand or,
     a much easier way, edit the configuration files *.cnf:

     In order to be able to do so, we provide some informations about
     the compiler flags used in reduma at the of this text.

  4. Just type `make' or `make install' to build the executables "lred"
     and "tred". To determine to location where to install *red change
     the entry for BINDIR within the file `red.cnf'.
     If you do not want to build "lred" and "tred" just add the
     preferred version after make

       i.e. make tred   or   make install-tred

  5. "lred" is the ASM interpreter with supercombinator reduction.
     "tred" is the ASM interpreter with closed contexts.
     For more information refer to the appropriate publications or
     send Email to base@informatik.uni-kiel.de

  6. Set the environment variable FHELPFILE in a way that it
     refers to the file creduma.hlp (found in the doc/ directory of
     this distribution)

       i.e. setenv FHELPFILE doc/creduma.hlp
