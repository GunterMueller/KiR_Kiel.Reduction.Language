Makefile for the reduction system pired+ with
generation scavengin garbage collector.

CAUTION!

(dg 30.07.92)

Only a subset of KiR (with respect to primitive functions)
is supported. These are artimetic/logic operations (+,- etc.)
basic list functions (lselect, lcut, lunite, lreplace, empty, ldim).

The complex matrix and vector operations are not yet prepared for
generation scavenging garbage collection.
