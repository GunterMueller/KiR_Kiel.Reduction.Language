Compiling Reduma
*****************

 Follow these steps to compile Reduma on a Unix system.

  1. If you have built Reduma previously in the same directory for a
     different target machine, do `make clean' to delete all files
     that might be invalid. 

  2. Make sure that your system has either `gawk' (version 2.15 or higher)
     or nawk (gawk 2.13 has a bug).
     On a System V release 4 system, make sure `/usr/bin' precedes
     `/usr/ucb' in `PATH'.  The `cc' command in `/usr/ucb' uses
     libraries which have bugs.

  3. Run `configure' to configure the Makefiles for your machine.

         configure machine

     where machine is one of the following system:

         sun, apollo, next, sgi, hp, linux
 
     If you are trying to compile the Reduma on another machine,
     you have to edit two Makefiles (in the same way) by hand:

     1. editor.obj/Makefile
     2. lred.obj/Makefile

     In order to be able to do so we provide some informations about
     the compiler flags used in reduma at the of this text.

  4. Just type `make' or `make install' to build the executable "lred".
     To determine to location where to install lred change the entry
     for BINDIR within the file `red.cnf'.
