<H1>Project Functions, Frames, and Interactions</H1>

<h2><a name="description">Project Description</a></h2>
<hr>

I'm trying to integrate Frames and Interactions into our reduction language
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/inf/Kluge/KiR/"><b>KiR</b></a>.
The notion of Frames originates from research in knowledge representation
and allows for a structured and hierarchically organized representation 
of knowledge.  
The main idea of my project is to build a simple language framework with
three major components: <b>functions</b>, <b>frames</b>, and <b>interactions</b>. 
<p>

The starting point is a <b>purely functional language</b>, which to my
experience is well suited for the representation of algorithms. We add
a single record-like type of data structure, called <b>frame</b> here, and
some associated primitive operations in such a way that the resulting
language should be equally well suited for the representation of
algorithmic and non-algorithmic knowledge.
<p>

To complete the framework, we allow programs to access their runtime
environment via so called <b>interactions</b>. This is basically a variant of
some approach to input/output-operations for purely functional languages.
In our framework, however, interactions are a means to handle not only 
input/output, but environment interactions in general. In particular,
they will allow to make large collections of algorithmic and non-algorithmic
knowledge persistent and to access such collections from functional programs.
<p>

The main application we have in mind is a module system. But instead of
adding such a system on top of our language, we intend to use the 
programming language itself as its own module language. Frames can be
used to organize programs into smaller, more comprehensible structures.
These structures can then be written to/read from the file system by primitive
input/output operations. Thus, modules are just data structures that
can be made to persist in the programming environment and that can be 
imported into other programs.
<p>

The programming environment resulting from this approach is not only 
simpler, but also more powerful than conventional systems. There is no
separate module language, large programs are treated just as any other
large collection of data. The input/output operations that are used
to make modules persistent can be used for other data as well. 
Since modules are imported using input/output, they are loaded at
runtime rather than at compile time. One can even think of providing
different conventions for module systems as a library.
<p>

While the original project proposal 
(<a href=public_doc/proposal.dvi.gz><em>"Funktionen & Frames"</em></a>, in german).
was quite abstract, the main interest has drifted towards more 
practical problems such as module systems and input/output.
Some <a href="papers.html">workshop papers</a> are available, which
address the concrete problems of module systems, data abstraction
and input/output-operations for functional languages. They should give
a good idea of how we want to solve these problems using frames and
interactions.  <p>

If you have any further question regarding this work, do not hesitate
to ask me. Otherwise
you may have to wait for my PhD thesis, to be expected sometime in
summer 1997 (I know, I shouldn't have said that ;-). <p>
