<H3>What are interactions?</H3>

First of all, interactions are a link between the program and the "environment",
in this case the filesystem. Programs with interactions can change the
environment and the result of the program execution is influenced by it. <br>
The interactions are like some standard I/O functions of C, though this seems 
to be not the best solution for functional languages (take dir() as an example).
Together with the bind-combintor one can do most things that one can do in C or
PASCAL ... only much nicer.<p>

<H3>Programming with monadic I/O</H3>

An advantage of functional programming languages is that their program
representation, in contrast to imperative languages, only fix a partial order of
evaluation at run time. Wherever a function call with its exact number of
arguments can be found inside a program it can be evaluated. This is possible
because functions in functional languages are free of side effects and therefore
guarantee the Church-Rosser property. But this is not true for the evaluation
order of interactions. Therefore there must be a mechanism in the reduction
system and some elements in the language which fix the evaluation order of
interactions. <br>
The mechanism used in Pi-Red based on monads. (See
<a href="#Timm96">[Timm96]</a> and <a href="#PJW93">[PJW93]</a> for detailed
information.) To fix the evaluation order of interactions the programmer must
use two standard functions, unit() and bind().
<dl>
<dt> unit(x)
<dd> unit(x) applies the monads type contructor to x. (!) That means that x is
     the result of an interaction execution (every interaction returns
     unit(result) ) and therefore is a proper argument for bind(). In KiR,
     unit() does nothing and is used and needed only in connection with bind().
<dt> bind(x,y)
<dd> bind() concatenates two expressions and fix the evaluation order of
     the interactions in them. First, all interactions in expression x are
     executed and then, if x could be reduced to an expression
     unit(<em>val</em>), the interactions in expression y. The expressions can
     be of any sort, especially being or containing bind() itself to fix the
     evaluation order of interactions in them. The second expression should be
     an unary function because during the reduction of a bind()-expression the
     second expression will be applied to the reduced first one.
</dl>

<b>How does the program notation fix the evaluation order of its interactions?
</b> <br>
There are only two positions where interactions are carried out: first, if they
are the goal expression of the KiR program, and second, if the goal expression
is a bind() and the interaction is the leftmost leaf of the tree, which is build
up by multiple, nested bind()-expressions. <br>
If the first expression of a bind() can be reduced to 'unit(x)'  the
'bind(unit(x),expr)' will be reduced to 'expr[x]'. <p>

Scheme: (assume that the expressions are goal expressions)
<pre>
interaction(args)  =&gt; unit(result)
bind(unit(x), f)   =&gt; f[x]
bind(expr, f)      =&gt; Evaluation of expr as if it was the goal expression.
</pre>

If the leftmost leaf of a bind() tree is no longer reducible and it is not a
unit(), then no further interactions can be carried out. <p>


<h3>Filehandles</h3>
On success, the interaction fopen returns a string which is used as filehandle
by some other interactions (fgetc, fclose). This filehandle has the following
shape: <br>
*&lt;filename&gt;*&lt;mode&gt;*&lt;nr&gt;* <br>
where
<ul>
<li> &lt;filename&gt; is the name and path of the file.
<li> &lt;mode&gt; is the file mode used by fopen.
<li> &lt;nr&gt; is an index to separate several filehandles of the same file.
</ul>

By opening a file the new filehandle is inserted in a filehandle list. By
closing a file its filehandle is removed from that list. To guarantee access to
a file, the list must contain the given filehandle, i.e. if you uses a
filehandle which is not in the list (perhaps you have already closed that
file), access will be denied. The list is for internal usage only, but can
be displayed by the editor command "environment" for debugging purposes.


<H3>The return value of an interaction</H3>
If an interaction is not executable, it returns a constructor of the shape
NE{string}, where string is some kind of message. On success, it returns a
constructor of the shape OK{value}, where value is the actual result of the
interaction (a character for fgetc, a string for fopen, etc.). For interactions
without an actual result value (fputc, fclose, etc.), the interaction name was
returned. <br>
Remember that the return value of an interaction is always enclosed by unit().
<p>
Examples:
<pre>
fgetc('*path/name*r*1*`)     --&gt; unit(OK{'r`})
fclose('*path/name*r*1*`)    --&gt; unit(OK{'fclose`})
fopen('Not_there`,'r`) --&gt; unit(NE{'fopen: Cannot open file.`})
</pre>


<h3>Standard I/O</h3>

The three standard I/O streams are opened in KiR, too. The corresponding 
filehandles are "STDIN", "STDOUT" and "STDERR". <p>

Note:
<ul>
<li>The closing of 'STDIN' is not advisable. ;-)
<li>You can use the 'fredirect`-interaction to redirect the standard input
    or output channel.
<li>The editor uses, if possible, a virtual screen which is not the shell
    screen. Input and Output is done in the normal shell screen so that it
    doesn't overwrite the editor screen. You can see the shell screen if
    <ul>
    <li>you exit the editor.
    <li>you use the screenswitch command (see below).
    <li>the KiR program expect user input.
    </ul>
<li>To avoid screen flickering, some people use the xterm resource
    "titeInhibit" (= true). This setting prevent the usage of a virtual screen
    by the editor, i.e. the editor uses the shell screen as well. In the latest
    pi-red version this cause the editor screen being scrambled by the input /
    output.
</ul>

<a name="newed"><H3>New editor commands/options</H3></a>

There are some new editor commands to support the interactive development of
programs containing interactions.
<dl>
<dt> screenswitch [scr]
<dd> Switches from editor screen to shell screen. Press any key to switch back.
     See note in section "Standard I/O", too.
<dt> environment [env]
<dd> Prints the current filehandle list to the shell screen and does a
     screenswitch.
<dt> iamode on|off [iam]
<dd> If iamode is off, interactions can be executed only at toplevel. When you
     select and reduce a subexpression, they will not be executed. With
     iamode on, interaction will be executed in subexpressions, also.<p>
     There is a new red.init line to set a standard value for iamode. It is
     placed between the lines "vertical display" and "lineoriented cursor mode"
     and is called "interact in subexpression : x", where x=0 for iamode off and
     x=1 for iamode on.
</dl>

There are two new editor startup options.
<dl>
<dt> -x inputfile
<dd> Redirects the standard input channel "STDIN" to inputfile (i.e.
     /dev/ttyp2).
<dt> -y outputfile
<dd> Redirects the standard output channel "STDOUT" to outputfile.
</dl>

<H2>Some new primitive functions for number-string-conversion</H2>
(These are not interactions!)
<dl>
<dt><a name="char"><B>char</B> ( <I>int</I> )</a>

     provides int or real to string conversion. Therefore arg must be an integer
     or real number and pattern must correspond to the type of arg. pattern
     consist of
     <ol>
     <li> optional flags: '-`, '+` and ' ` (Blank)
     <li> optional fieldwidth: [0-9]*
     <li> optional precision: '.` [0-9]*
     <li> type descriptor, {diouxX} for integer and {feEgG} for real numbers.
     </ol>

<dt><a name="sscanf"><B>sscanf</B> ( <I>pattern string</I> )</a>
<dd> Returns a integer or real number. sscanf is similar to the C function,
     but it only provides string to number conversion. pattern consist of
     <ol>
     <li> optional fieldwidth: [0-9]*
     <li> type descriptor, {dioux} for integer and {feg} for real numbers.
     </ol>
</dl>

See man pages and C documentation to learn more about pattern for sprintf and
sscanf, but remember: there's only a pattern for one number.
