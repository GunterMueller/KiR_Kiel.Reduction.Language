<H2>How to implement interactions in Pi-Red+.</H2>

To implement an interaction, you need a stack element to represent the
interaction, a C function which executes it and entries in several tables.
There are three main parts: the editor, the reduction unit (reduma) and, if you
wish, the compiling version of pi-red, tasm. <p>

First, you have to find the smallest free index for your interaction, maybe a
free entry in intact_tab[] (rintact.c) or size(intact_tab[]). The general
appearance of a stack element in the editor is 0x80ii00j1, where ii is the index
and j the arity of the interaction. In the reduma, the last digit isn't 1 but 8,
i.e. 0x80ii00j8. <p>

In the following, we use the interaction remove() as an example. It has index
0x12 and arity 1. <p>

<dl>
<dt><b>The editor</b>
<dd> Define the stack element in cencod.h: #define IA_REMOVE 0x80120011L <br>
     In ciotab.c, add one entry to kwtb[] and interactions[]. <br>
     kwtb[]: ,E_FUNC, IA_REMOVE, "remove", "", 0,5,0 | PREDEF <br> 
     interactions[]: ,"remove"   ,IA_REMOVE  ,func_arity(IA_REMOVE)

<dt><b>The reduma</b>
<dd> <ul>
     <li> Define the stack element in rstelem.h:
     <pre>
     #define P_IA_REMOVE     P_IFUNCCOMPL 
     #define _IA_REMOVE      0x8012 
     #define IA_REMOVE       SA_I(_IA_REMOVE,1) 
     #define T_IA_REMOVE(x)  (((x) & P_IA_REMOVE) == IA_REMOVE)
     </pre>
     <li> In rintact.c, add one entry to intact_tab[]:
          ,{red_remove, "ia_remove"} <br>
     The entry must be the 19th in the table, i.e. its position must match the
     index of the interaction plus 1 (index of remove is 18 (0x12) and the first
     entry has index 0).
     <li> Add a prototype of red_remove() in rintact.h.
     <li> Add the definition of red_remove(), the C function which executes the
          interaction, to riafunc.c.
     </ul>

<dt><b>Tasm</b>
<dd> To recognize interactions in the ASM code, add <br>
     ia_remove{OPTTYPES} {yylval.primf.types=str2type(yytext); return
     IA_REMOVE;} <br>
     to tasm2c.l and <br>
     %token  IA_REMOVE <br>
     and <br>
     interact: IA_REMOVE {$$.prf=ia_remove; $$.types=$1.types; uses_apply=TRUE;}
     <br> to tasm2c.y.<br>
     In mytypes.h, add ia_remove to the enumeration IACTION.
     In globals.h, insert "IA_REMOVE" to intact_tab[].
     Again, the position of ia_remove must match the index of IA_REMOVE plus 1.
     <br> In support.c, add 'case ia_remove:' to get_ia_arity().
</dl>

That's all, but I surely have forgotten something. :-)

<H2>Hints for further work.</H2>

<dl>
<dt> Support comand line arguments.
<dd> Especially for programs that has been compiled by TASM (the compiling
version of Pi-Red+), one can think of comand line arguments, which are provided
to the program at start time and can be access by using some global, predefined
variables. 
<dt> Unify state messages for NE results.
<dd> If a interaction is not executable, the result is NE{msg}, where msg is
some sort of message string. This is very handsome for users (it is readable),
but not so for computational evaluation. Therefore there should be some set of
indexed, uniformly messages which are used by every interaction. For easier
computational evaluation, the result should be changed to NE{num,msg}, where num
is the index of the standard message msg.
