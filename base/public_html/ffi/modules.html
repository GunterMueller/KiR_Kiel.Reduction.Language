<h2>How To Model Modules in KiR</h2>

Some of the several possible variants are:

<dl>
<dt>The Static Module Approach    
<dd>The standard variant (also used for the <a href="edlib/index.html">KiR 
    library collection</a>) where each module is simply a frame of 
    functions/expressions and the main program does the imports statically, 
    using either:
    <dl>
    <dt>$-variables 
    <dd>modules are stored in internal editor format and are included
        by the editor
    <dt>!-variables
    <dd>modules are stored in internal graph fromat (preprocessed and
        compiled) using the interaction <code>put</code> and are loaded 
        by the preprocessor
    </dl>
    <p>

<dt>The Makefile Approach
<dd>Each module is defined as a function from its imports to its export frame.
    Additionaly, a control program (makefile) is given that knows about
    all dependencies and about all filenames, gets all modules from the 
    environment and applies them to their respective imports.
    <p>

<dt>The Active Module Approach
<dd>Each module is defined as a program that dynamically gets all its 
    imports from the environment and returns an export frame.
    <p>

<dt>The Passive Module Approach
<dd>Each module is defined as a frame composed of all import file names
    and a function from its imports to its export frame. The importing
    program uses the import specification to get all imports from the 
    environment and apply all modules to their respective imports.
    <p>

</dl>

The passive module approach is a modular variant of the makefile approach.
The active module approach looks even more modular, but may have problems
with recursive imports (the fact that control has to be passed to imported
modules has both advantages and disadvantages).

<h2>Mutually Recursive Modules</h2>

Mutual recursion for modules will usually be avoided since it introduces
such a strong binding between the modules that none of them can be used
independent of the others and thus contradicts (some of) the goals of 
modularization. There are situations in procedural languages where the 
behaviour of imported modules is modified using global variables. Since
this isn't possible in pure functional languages, mutually recursive
modules are sometimes used instead (the importing module depends on the
imported module, the imported module depends on the parameters defined
in the importing module). These situations can be treated more directly
in KiR using parameterized modules.
<p>

If mutual recursion cannot be avoided, it is conceptually simple to achieve:
modules are first class values in KiR and therefore the usual recursion
operators of the language may be used to define mutually recursive module
structures. However, there is a problem here due to our applicative order
reduction scheme since in a naive (and natural) implementation these modules 
structures would be recursive data structures (any attempt to evaluate or 
print them will not terminate).
<p>

<h3>The Odd/Even Example</h3>

Here is an example. Note how the code looks quite natural although
the problems of mutually recursive data structures under 
an applicative order regime have been avoided (note also how this
kind of 'modularization` does not make much sense here;-).

<hr>
<b>Even:</b>

<pre>
def 
  EvenM [ OddM ] = def 
                     &from OddM [ EvenM ] 
                      import [ Odd ] ,
                     Even [ N ] = if ( N lt 2 )
                                  then ( N eq 0 )
                                  else Odd [ ( N - 1 ) ]
                   in struct 
                      entry 'module` : 'Even` ,
                      entry 'Even` : Even
                      end
in EvenM
</pre>

<hr>
<b>Odd:</b>

<pre>
def 
  OddM [ EvenM ] = def 
                     &from EvenM [ OddM ] 
                      import [ Even ] ,
                     Odd [ N ] = if ( N lt 2 )
                                 then ( N eq 1 )
                                 else Even [ ( N - 1 ) ]
                   in struct 
                      entry 'module` : 'Odd` ,
                      entry 'Odd` : Odd
                      end
in OddM
</pre>

<hr>
<b>Main program:</b>

<pre>
def 
  &from ap $Odd
        to [ $Even ] 
   import [ Odd ]
in Odd [ 42 ]
</pre>
