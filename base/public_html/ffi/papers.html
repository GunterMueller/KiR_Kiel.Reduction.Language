<h2><a name="papers">Project Papers</a></h2>

<em>
These papers were written in an early phase of the project and my view
of things has changed slightly since then. However, they do already contain 
the fundamental ideas of the language design. I suggest to start with the
shorter abstract, which is also more to the point, and to skip those parts
of the full paper that are too lengthy. I am currently writing my PhD thesis,
of which I hope to have a complete version by (the end of) July 1997. 
Comments and questions are most welcome.

    This paper describes some proposals for improving the reduction
    language KiR with respect to data abstraction, modularization and
    input/output.  Rather than adding specialized language elements for
    each purpose, an attempt is made to provide the desired functionality
    by way of only two extensions. These are frames (record-like data
    structures) and interactions (constructs describing communications with
    the program's runtime environment). The main topic is the unified
    treatment of language elements for programming-in-the-large within
    the framework of an untyped, purely functional language. Both modules
    and data abstraction are modeled as first class data structures.

   <p>
   Combining modules as first class data structures with explicit
   input/output-operations for arbitrary expressions in a purely
   functional programming language brings the flexibility of
   integrated programming environments under control of the functional 
   language.
   <p>
   Compared with conventional module systems, the proposed solution provides
   enhanced functionality in a simpler framework, using the functional
   language as an unrestricted module language and the extended 
   input/output-facilities to make modules persistent.
   <p>
   <em>This is an extended abstract (7 pages) based on the talks given in
       Bastad and Passau. It is intended as a complement to the first paper</em>
