<h2>Implementation Overview</h2>

As part of the <a href="index.html">FFI</a> project, the implementation
of our reduction language 
<a href="../languages/index.html#KiR">KiR</a>
has been extended with facilities for input/output (interactions) and record-like 
data structures (frames).

There are currently two people working on the implementation:
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~stt/">S. Timm</a> (MSc student) and 
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~cr/">C. Reinke</a> (PhD student).
The topics under implementation are:
<p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="stt/intact.html">
    input/output for streams and files of characters</a>
<dd>A variant based on monadic i/o is ready to be tested by KiR programmers.
    The set of primitive interactions is similar to the basic i/o operations
    in C. Of course, we do not expect this to be an ideal solution for an interactive
    reduction system implementing a purely functional language, but we would like to 
    collect some experience with this variant since this is what most of our 
    <em>non-users</em> wanted to have (<em>".. but you can't do this, and
    you can't do that in KiR .. and look how simple it is in C .."</em>).
    We are very interested to learn about your experiences (good or bad)
    with the current system before we attempt to design a better one.  
    <p>

<dt><a href="frames.html">frames</a>
<dd>An initial variant of  is available. The set 
    of frame operations and the overall syntax may change as we gain experience with 
    the existing variant. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
    <p>

<dt>Interactions for arbitrary expressions 
<dd>An alpha-version is included in tred.
    <br>
    (interactions <code>get( filehandle )</code> and 
                  <code>put( filehandle, expression )</code>.
    <p>

<dt><a href="modules.html">modules in KiR</a> / <a href="edlib/index.html">collection of libraries</a>
    <p>

</dl>


Any proposals on useful operations or features, problem reports and other 
questions related to these extensions should be directed to 
C. Reinke.
