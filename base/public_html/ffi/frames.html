<h2>Frames in KiR</h2>

<hr>
Frames have been introduced into KiR as part of the <a href="index.html">FFI</a> 
project. They may be used to model modules and data abstractions as first-class 
data structures (see <a href="papers.html">project papers</a>).
<p>

NOTE: Not only is the KiR-syntax different from the one used in my papers, it
will also take some time to implement all the proposed features. The system
has been designed to be simple on the language level, not to be simple on
the implementation level. 
<p>

You may construct record-like data structures and apply some primitive
operations to them.  Frame construction is strict. This, as well as all
other details may change without notice. As the current specification
allows for great freedom in the use of frame operations, the current
implementation is based on association lists, which are searched
linearly without optimizations.  So, don't expect too good efficiency.

<li><strong>Syntax:</strong>
<pre>
<em>frame</em> = struct 
        <em>slots</em> 
        end
<em>slots</em> = entry <em>slotname</em> : <em>slotvalue</em> [, <em>slots</em>]
<em>slotname</em> = <em>string</em>
<em>slotvalue</em> = <em>expression</em>
</pre>
<p>

<li><strong>Operations:</strong>
    <dl>
    <dt><pre>ftest( <em>frame</em> , <em>slotname</em> )</pre>
    <dd>test whether there is a slot with the given name in frame
    <dt><pre>fselect( <em>frame</em> , <em>slotname</em> )</pre>
    <dd>select named slot from frame
    <dt><pre>fupdate( <em>frame</em> , <em>slotname</em> , <em>slotvalue</em> )</pre>
    <dd>if named slot exists, return new frame with modified slotvalue.
    <dd>if named slot does not exist, it will be added
    <dt><pre>fdelete( <em>frame</em> , <em>slotname</em> )</pre>
    <dd>return copy of <em>frame</em> without named slot 
    <dt><pre>fslots( <em>frame</em> )</pre>
    <dd>return list of slotnames for <em>frame</em>
    </dl>
    <p>

<li><strong>Syntactic Sugar:</strong>
    <pre>
    def
      &from !LIST
       import [ Map, Fold ]
    in Fold [ +, 0, Map [ sub [ X ] in ( X * X ), &lt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5&gt; ] ]
    </pre>
    is a shorthand (you should never see the unique module identifiers which
    are used internally) for:
    <pre>
    def
      &\001\002 [ ] =  !LIST
      Map [ ] = fselect( &\001\002, 'Map` )
      Fold [ ] = fselect( &\001\002, 'Fold` )
    in Fold [ +, 0, Map [ sub [ X ] in ( X * X ), &lt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5&gt; ] ]
    </pre>
