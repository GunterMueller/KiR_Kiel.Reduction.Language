Compiling Reduma(lneu)
**********************

 Follow these steps to compile Reduma on a Unix system.

  1. If you have built Reduma previously in the same directory for a
     different target machine, do `make clean' to delete all files
     that might be invalid. 

  2. On a System V release 4 system, make sure `/usr/bin' precedes
     `/usr/ucb' in `PATH'.  The `cc' command in `/usr/ucb' uses
     libraries which have bugs.

  3. Run `configure' to configure the Makefiles for your machine.

         configure machine

     where machine is one of the following system:

         sun, apollo, hp, next
 
     If you are trying to compile the Reduma on another machine,
     you have to edit two Makefiles by hand:

     1. editor/Makefile
     2. src/Makefile

     In order to be able to do so we provide some informations about
     the compiler flags used in reduma at the end of this text.

  4. Just type `make' to build the executable "lneu".

  5. Copy the executable 'lneu`, the help file 'creduma.hlp` and the
     initialisation file 'red.init` to any directory of your choice.

  6. Before executing 'lneu` make sure the environment variable
     FHELPFILE points to the file 'creduma.hlp`. E.g. if you
     unpacked the package in your home directory you have to enter:

         setenv FHELPFILE ~/lneu/creduma.hlp
     
     Otherwise to online help within lneu is not avialable.
